 question 1> You have two tables: "Customers" and "Purchases." 
The "Customers" table has the following columns: CustomerID, CustomerName.
The "Purchases" table has the following columns: PurchaseID, PurchaseDate, CustomerID, ProductID.
Write a Pyspark Code to find the customers who have purchased all Types of  products.
Assume you have customer_df and purchase_df as dataframes 
customer_df,purchase_df

Code: 
customer_purchase_df=customer_df.join(purchase_df,customer_df['CustomerID']==purchase_df['CustomerID'],"inner")

customer_product_count_df=customer_purchase_df.groupBy("CustomerID").agg(countDistinct("ProductID")\
.alias("product_count"))

distinct_product_count=purchase_df.select(countDistinct("ProductID")).collect[0][0]

final_df=customer_product_count_df.filter(customer_product_count_df["product_count"]==distinct_product_count)

resultant_df=final_df.select("CustomerID","CustomerName").collect()
